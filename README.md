# Online Store Project - Allegro Imitation

This project is an online store designed to imitate the functionalities of **Allegro**. It was developed during my fourth year of technical school using **pure PHP** for the backend and **SCSS/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. 

## Key Features:
- **User Login**: Allows users to log in (sessions are unstable due to lack of asynchronous handling).
- **User Registration**: New users can create accounts.
- **Add Products to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Create Products**: Users can create new product listings.
- **Templating**: Pages are dynamically generated with data from the database.
- **Shipment Tracking**: Authorized users can view and change the status of shipments.
- **Delete Listings**: Employees can remove product listings.
- **Employee Application Form**: Users can apply to become employees through a dedicated form.
- **Admin Panel**: A control panel for administrators to manage the system.

## Challenges:
One of the main challenges was session management, which is unstable due to a lack of asynchronous processing. Additionally, while the design is chaotic, it remains functional and readable.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: PHP (no frameworks)
- **Frontend**: SCSS, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL (or whichever DBMS you used)

## Future Improvements:
- Implement proper asynchronous handling to stabilize session management.
- Improve the design to make it more structured and visually appealing.

This project reflects my growth in full-stack web development, tackling both the frontend and backend of an e-commerce platform.
